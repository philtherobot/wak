# wak

*wak is a get-off-the-ground name, a completly bogus name!*

wak is an alternative runtime for C++.  The reason a new runtime
is needed is to enable denser, more compact coding in C++.  You
program with wak in the language you know, but in a world of
simpler, straight to the point statements.  No legacy or 
details meant for rarely encountered situations.

There are two downsides:
- a complete runtime must be supported and learned anew
- performance is treated with little respect

But those problems are offset by:
- the runtime is smaller
- the runtime repeats the same ideas over and over
- if you want performance, you can get it by writing fast C++ 
  code the traditional way
